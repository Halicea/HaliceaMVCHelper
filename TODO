TODO List for HalWebProject
===========================
	
	1. Packager: list the packages. (IMPORTANT)
	2. Routes routing
	3. Tornado integration
	4. Repository implementation (IMPORTANT)
	    - pack(Done), unpack(Done), update, delete
	    - required packages
	    - pypy, easy_install packages generation maybe???
	        - Think about this
	5. Documentation (IMPORTANT)
	6. I18n Internationalisation (IMPORTANT)
	    - Make it simple
	    - pom files to be generated automaticly
	    - To be independent of the templating system
	    - Use the known libraries that do this.
	    - Will need to see what to do about the caching on this
	 
	7. Web Page

	8. Create repo website
	   -host it somewhere
	
	9. Create proxy renderers(Django, Jinja, Hal e.t.c) in order to be able to switch the templating systems without controller changes.
	    - What about the forms??? Think about it First
	    - Think about caching mechanism (Appengine will have memcache for sure)
	10. Compile a set of items to create independent framework
		- Tornado as a web server
		- Jinja templating system
		- memcache (distibuted cache)
		- Routes as a routing dispatcher
		- Hal as web framework
	11. Make some easy to start UI
		- Maybe self hosted Hall application??
		- Maybe some simple tkniter??? 
		- THink about it
	12. Git (initialy create a git repo for the project)
	    - only with the flag *--git*
	    - Some pygit lirary would do this
	13. PyPy setup for Hal
	    - >>>easy_install hal 
	    - >>>pypy hal
	    - dependencies 
	    	- tornado
	    	- routes
	     	- appengine	   
	14. Strategy Enum that will be used for creating the templates for Controllers, Models and ModelForms
	    - Comments 
		File Per Item
		File Per Module
